## Projects

### Drug Classification   
    🏷️ data cleaning, data wrangling, insights for business, classification 
        algorithm.
    🔍 Business problem: how accurately can we prescribe the correct 
        treatment?
    🧰 Solution: it was possible get some insights with the exploratory 
        analysis, but for accuracy the classification algorithm will 
        be a better solution.
    💡 Conclusion:
      - The drug A is prescripted on this sample for people younger 
      than 50 years, with high blood pressure and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug B is prescripted on this sample for people older than 
      50 years, with high blood pressure and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug C is prescripted on this sample for people with low 
      blood pressure, high colesterol, and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug X is prescripted on this sample for people with normal 
      or low blood pressure and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug Y is prescripted on this sample for people with Na to k 
      higher than 15;
      - The baseline dummy classifier(45%) loosed for logistic regression 
      model which predict correctly the treatment 89%.
    💯 Next steps: collect more data and tune the model.

### Rent Calculator  
    🏷️ data cleaning, data wrangling, feature engineering, regression algorithm, 
    tuning model, deploying model
    🔍 Business problem: create a calculator to predict the rent value for client 
    at Florianópolis - Santa Catarina - BR
    🧰 Solution: web scrap the site to get all the informations, clean the data 
    and explore that, define the features and the target, test regression models, 
    tune and define the better model to deploy it.
    💡Conclusion:
      - the baseline was linear regression and other model tested was decision 
      tree, lasso and SVR;
      - None of the models get a good performance and the better result was 
      predict 35% correctly;
      - The dataset is small and the data was collected at summer season, which
      makes really high rent prices on the isle.
    💯 Next steps: tuning the model and dig deeper on statistics metrics to see 
    if the model construction is possible or not with this sample.
