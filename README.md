### Drug Classification   
    üè∑Ô∏è Classification algorithm
    Business problem: how accurately can we prescribe the correct treatment?
    Solution: it was possible get some insights with the exploratory analysis, but for accuracy 
              the classification algorithm will be a better solution.
    Conclusion:
      - the drug A is prescripted on this sample for people younger than 50 years, with high blood pressure 
      and Na to K lower than 15;
      - the drug B is prescripted on this sample for people older than 50 years, with high blood pressure 
      and Na to K lower than 15;
      - the drug C is prescripted on this sample for people with low blood pressure, high colesterol, 
      and Na to K lower than 15;
      - the drug X is prescripted on this sample for people with normal or low blood pressure and
      Na to K lower than 15;
      - the drug Y is prescripted on this sample for people with Na to k higher than 15;
      - the baseline dummy classifier(45%) loosed for logistic regression model which predict 
      correctly the treatment 89%
    Next steps: colect more data and tuning the model
