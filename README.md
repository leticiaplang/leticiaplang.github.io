### Drug Classification   
    ▫️ data cleaning, data wrangling, insights for business, classification 
        algorithm.
    🔸 Business problem: One of the biggest pain at healthcare services is
        the medication and prescription errors. According Rayhan A. and 
        collegue's article the ordering/prescribing errors include 50% of 
        the total medications errors. It's harms not only the patient, 
        familly and professionals, as the company, once it's esteemed an 
        bigger cost of $40 billion each year to look after these patients. 
        This algorithm is the first step to construct an MVP looking for 
        help at secure medication presciption. After that we are going 
        analyse dosage data and a bigger sample for better results.
    🔸 Solution: analyse the possibility of get the necessary insights
        to predict the prescription, than, create the first version 
        of classification model.
    🔸 Conclusion:
      - The drug A is prescripted on this sample for people younger 
      than 50 years, with high blood pressure and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug B is prescripted on this sample for people older than 
      50 years, with high blood pressure and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug C is prescripted on this sample for people with low 
      blood pressure, high colesterol, and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug X is prescripted on this sample for people with normal 
      or low blood pressure and Na to K lower than 15;
      - The drug Y is prescripted on this sample for people with Na to k 
      higher than 15;
      - The baseline dummy classifier(45%) loosed for logistic regression 
      model which predict correctly the treatment 89%.
    🔸 Next steps: collect more data, tune the model and insert the dosage.

### Rent Calculator  
    ▫️ data cleaning, data wrangling, feature engineering, regression algorithm, 
    tuning model, deploying model
    🔸 Business problem: create a calculator to predict the rent value for client 
    at Florianópolis - Santa Catarina - BR
    🔸 Solution: web scrap the site to get all the informations, clean the data 
    and explore that, define the features and the target, test regression models, 
    tune and define the better model to deploy it.
    🔸Conclusion:
      - the baseline was linear regression and other model tested was decision 
      tree, lasso and SVR;
      - None of the models get a good performance and the better result was 
      predict 35% correctly;
      - The dataset is small and the data was collected at summer season, which
      makes really high rent prices on the isle.
    🔸 Next steps: tuning the model and dig deeper on statistics metrics to see 
    if the model construction is possible or not with this sample.
